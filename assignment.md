# Assignment: Website Development for Hot Beans Web

## Justification of Design Decisions

### Design Choices

1. **Color Scheme**: 
   - **Hot Red (#FF5733)**: This vibrant color is used to draw attention to key elements such as headings and borders. It conveys energy and passion, aligning with the dynamic nature of the web development industry.
   - **Spicy Orange (#FF8D1A)**: Used for hover effects, this color adds a touch of warmth and friendliness, enhancing user interaction.
   - **Bean Brown (#5C3A29)**: This earthy tone is used for the background of the cards and the footer, providing a strong, stable base that contrasts well with the brighter colors.
   - **Creamy Beige (#F5F5DC)**: This neutral color is used for text and background elements to ensure readability and a clean, professional look.

2. **Card Layout**: 
   - The card layout is chosen to present information about team members and trainee developers in a structured and visually appealing manner. Each card contains a name, role, and a brief description, making it easy for users to quickly understand the team's composition and expertise.
   - The use of cards also allows for a responsive design, as they can easily be rearranged to fit different screen sizes.

3. **Responsive Design**: 
   - The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This is achieved through the use of flexible layouts, media queries, and scalable elements.
   - A responsive design is crucial for providing a positive user experience, as it allows users to access the website from any device without compromising on usability or aesthetics.
4. **Images**: 
   - **Logo**: The logo is chosen to establish a strong brand identity and create a professional impression. It ensures users can immediately recognize the website and associate it with the web development course. Placing the logo prominently in the header aligns with user requirements for easy navigation and brand visibility.
   - **Homepage Image**: The homepage image is carefully selected to represent the theme of web development and creativity. It visually engages users and sets the tone for the website, making it appealing and relevant to the target audience. This choice meets user requirements by enhancing the aesthetic appeal and providing a welcoming first impression.
   - Both images are optimized for web use to ensure fast loading times and responsiveness, which is critical for maintaining a positive user experience across different devices.
